You need to add a terraform.tfvars file in the project's root path

You can define whatever you want depending of the variables.tf's content.


This project helps you to create : 

- VPC
- 2 public subnets
- 2 private subnet for APP / WEB servers
- 2 private subnets for RDS
- 1 Application Loadbalancer

It doesn't handle HTTPS for the moment

But it'll come soon.

I'll add Security, monitoring features etc... too
